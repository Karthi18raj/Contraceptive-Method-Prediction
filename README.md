• The prediction of women not using contraceptive method as using contraceptive method is more important than the inverse case.
• If the prediction of the women using contraceptive method as not using can be ignored but it also should not be high as the cost for resources in creating awareness will go to waste.
• The Main insight for the model is to predict who are not using so the awareness can be focused on those segments.
• The Decision tree is pruned for solving overfitting.
• AUC Score is more than 0.70 for both train and test only for CART.
• Among the three(Log Reg,LDA,CART), CART is the best model for prediction.
